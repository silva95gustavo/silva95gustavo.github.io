# Personal Website of Gustavo Silva

This is the source code for my personal website, built with HTML, CSS, and Jekyll.

## Local Development

To serve the website locally, you need to have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) installed. If you don't have it yet, you can install it with:

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Once Jekyll is installed, you can serve the site locally with:

```bash
jekyll serve
```

This will start a local server, usually at `http://localhost:4000`, where you can preview the website.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main landing page
- `assets/`: Contains images, CSS, JS, and fonts
- Other folders may include blog posts, CV, and additional content
